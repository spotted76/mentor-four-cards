## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Leaned in to grid a little more.  Actually switched from grid to flex when going from desktop to mobile layout.  These seemed to work really well, and minimized the amount of css changes for the media query.

Leveraged background image for the cards, seemed to be the easiest way to go.
